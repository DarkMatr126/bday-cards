            <p>Mr. Arnell is a history teacher at Churchill Jr High. He is famous for his jokes and overall funny character. Everyone loves trashket ball, a game invented by Arnell himself. Some other activities include Story Time, Current Events, and Emails. Having him at the end of the day is an amazing way to end school for the day.</p>
